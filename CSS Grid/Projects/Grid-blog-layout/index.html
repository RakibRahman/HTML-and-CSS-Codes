        <h2>Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.</h2>
        <span>-Benjamin Franklin</span>
    
        <p>Dear Life,</p>
    
        <p>People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed and the more they find a way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward spiral that can even become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

          <p>This is a poem by
            <a href="#">John The Believer</a>

        <p>The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won't. It's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere.</p>

          <p>"The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary."</p>

        <p>When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it.</p>

        <p>First, have a definite, clear practical ideal; a goal, an objective. Second, have the necessary means to achieve your ends; wisdom, money, materials, and methods. Third, adjust all your means to that end.Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So, throw off the bowlines, sail away from safe harbor, catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore, Dream, Discover.</p>

        <p>"You’ve got a pain deep in your bones, son. It compels you forward like you’re tied to a slave master’s cruel hand, and
          it's the same pain that drives that oppressor’s heart of stone, so you’ve grown to love the man. You keep pouring yourself
          out, again and again, into legible lines through a crooked pen." Yeah, it’s painful, but it’s familiar – so habit breeds
          comfort, and I don’t know what I’d do without him</p>

        <p>So in the early morning, when you’ve fallen asleep in our home, I drift back into the memories that I’ve claimed as my
          own, and wonder if tonight will be a night I’ll hang on my wall like I did before we stopped taking photos, out of
          the habit of being comfortable with not trying at all</p>
    
        <p>In a perfect world, we’ll have albums labeled Seasons, with chapter headings, and we’ll staple them to the cork-board
          that hangs at the foot of the bed. There’s longevity in a memory spilt out in pen, and if a picture is worth a thousand
          words then I’ve written down every one of them</p>
    
        <p>I work hard, scarred, toil through that soil for the youth I see in my friends, but these journals are moments in time,
          snapshots of our lives, and in retrospect, age is an overexposed photo that the memories can't mend</p>

        <p>I know my sweet seductress, and her name is Depression. I wrote best beneath that demon’s destructive oppression</p>
    
    
        <p>In those Polaroids, she drove the ink into the canvas like a slave beneath his master’s cruel hand, and I hated that
          whip but always wondered what I’d do without it, so I grew to love the man</p>
    
        <p>Oh, I wept for change! I begged for movement and the good Lord, he answered my prayers, but you don’t know how to breathe
          easy when you let go of your habits, even if your comforts left you gasping for air</p>

        <h2>Dear Time</h2>
    
        <p>Grandfather's as creaky as his front porch, scent like oil in the gun barrel, dip-can kicked over the railing, sandpaper
          hands stuck behind thumb tacks on my wall. I’ve got an ache in my chest for every season I miss and it gets worse when
          the snow starts to fall. There are butterflies alive in that couple’s eyes a few years since forgotten by all, and
          sometimes, if the phone starts to ring, I can still hear their wings when you call</p>
    
        <p>But I begged for movement and I got what I asked for, and I can picture the answer like it came yesterday. And in the
          land of the gods, I think that things are timeless, but we are still prone to decay</p>
    
        <p>You know I still lift up hope of certain smiles in those photos for us when I pray</p>

        <p>Time is a cruel lover, and she breaks her house apart at its bones. You know comfort is no good reason for standing still,
          and idle hands build nothing that you can call your own.</p>
